More than one thousand URL shortener domains collection for whitelist/allowlist or blacklist/blocklist purpose.

NextDNS, RethinkDNS, ControlD and dnslow.me use this to provide amazing service. You can also use this domain list in your network environment to block/unblock URL shorteners, or use it as one of the indicators of the domain trustworthy score, at your own risk.

Data in this repository will not be updated in realtime, the effort to maintain the list is huge, feel free to submit report of missing domains or false positives, donations are also very welcome.

Those false-postive URL shortener domains, or the domains were used as url-shortener but now abandoned, will not be listed in the `list` file, but will be listed in the `inactive` file.
